# Assignment 2: Grade Calculator

This assignment allows students to familiar themselves with Qt Creator while creating a grade calculator
for both Pic 10B: Intermediate Programming and Pic 10C: Advanced Programming. Not only do students have to
consider the two different course options, but the two different schemas each course allows for students to
use when actually calculating their final grades. 

## Pic 10B: Intermediate Programming

All students are assigned 8 homeworks but only the highest 7 are graded. 

### Schema A:

|Homeworks (1-8) | Midterm 1 |Midterm 2 | Final Exam | 
| ---|---| ---| ---|
|25% |20% | 20%| 35%|

### Schema B:

|Homeworks (1-8) | Highest Midterm | Final Exam | 
| ---|---| ---| ---|
|25% |30%| 44%|


## Pic 10C: Advanced Progamming

### Schema A:

|Assignments | Midterm |Final Exam | Final Project | 
| ---|---| ---| ---|
|15% |25% | 30%| 35%|


### Schema B:

|Assignments | Final Exam | Final Project | 
| ---|---| ---| ---|
|15% |50%| 35%|
